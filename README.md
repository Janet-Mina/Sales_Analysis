### Findings
**1. Which region is generating the most revenue?**

The **West** generates the highest revenue with **$725,458**, followed by the **East** with **$678,781**. The **South region** has the lowest revenue at **$391,722**. This indicates that targeted strategies might be needed to improve revenue in underperforming regions like the South.

**2. Which product category is the most profitable?**

The **Office Supplies** category is the most profitable, contributing *39%* of the total profit, followed by **Technology** at *37%*. **Furniture**, despite having significant revenue, contributes only *24%* to profits, suggesting higher costs or lower margins in this category.

**3. What is the sales trend like?**

Monthly sales show a fluctuation, with peaks in **December ($232,062) and August ($209,768)**. This indicates possible seasonal trends or promotional impacts during these months. Strategies to sustain sales during low months like **September ($151,496) and February ($161,214)** can be considered.

**4. What is the number of orders in each state?**

The state with the highest number of orders is **California (2001 orders)**, while some states have significantly fewer orders. This suggests high customer density or strong brand presence in California. Efforts to expand reach in underperforming states could boost overall sales.

**5. What is the most used shipping mode?**

The **Standard Class** shipping mode is used the most, accounting for *60%* of all shipments. "Second Class" and "First Class" follow at *24%* and *15%*, respectively. "Same Day" shipping accounts for only *5%*, possibly due to higher costs or limited demand.

**6. Which segment patronizes the most?**

From the data, it can be inferred that the Consumer segment dominates patronage. Additional data on segment-wise sales is required for more precise insights.

**7. Which product sub-category generates the most revenue?**

**Phones** is the top revenue-generating sub-category with **$330,007**, followed by **Chairs ($223,844)**. These items should be prioritized in marketing and inventory planning.

**2. Profit Optimization:** Re-evaluate pricing or cost structures in the Furniture category to improve profitability.

**3. Seasonal Promotions:** Plan strategic sales and promotions during low months to sustain revenue throughout the year.

**4. State Expansion:** Increase presence in states with low orders through localized advertising and distribution.

**5. Shipping Options:** Promote faster shipping modes like "Same Day" to appeal to time-sensitive customers.

**6. Consumer Engagement:** Strengthen loyalty programs for the Consumer segment to maintain high patronage.
